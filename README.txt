1. Requiremed packages to be installed to run the program:
	1. cv2(OpenCV)
	2. csv
	3. numpy
	4. matplotlib
2. First the program asks the user whether he/she wants to select the points and classify them into river and non-river classes.
3. If yes(N) then,
The program operates on the default data-set that has already been given.
4. If yes(Y) then,
-> First the program displays an image asks to select 50 points in river-class. After selecting these points the image must be closed.
-> Then the program displays another image to select 100 points in non-river-class. After selecting these points the image must be closed.
5. After acquiring the data-set, the program finally displays 3 images as output
	1. P1=0.3 AND P2=0.7
	2. P1=0.7 AND P2=0.3
	3. P1=0.5 AND P2=0.5
